In this post I showcase how little shite I know about game development.ðŸ˜…
It's a simple example of how you can draw a line in Godot to visualize Vectors.

# Drawing some lines
The end-result will display a graph with a vector that is pointing towards a poodle.
Next to the poodle we will display it's current position in vector space.

The demo consists of 2 scripts.
* `VectorsInSpace.cs` which is attached to the root node of the scene and draws the graph and vector lines.
* `PoodleBehaviour.cs` which is attached to the Poodle Sprite node and sets the text of the label next to the Poodle.

## `VectorsInSpace.cs`
```csharp

using Godot;

public class VectorsInSpace : Node2D
{
    private Sprite _poodle;

    public override void _Draw()
    {
        DrawLine(new Vector2(0, 0), new Vector2(2000, 0), Colors.Wheat, 5f);
        DrawLine(new Vector2(0, 0), new Vector2(0, 2000), Colors.Wheat, 5f);

        DrawLine(new Vector2(0, 0), _poodle.Position, Colors.DarkOrange, 3f);
    }

    public override void _Ready()
    {
        _poodle = GetNode<Sprite>("Poodle");
    }
}

```
Inside the `_Draw()` method I can call `DrawLine()` to draw a line from the first to the second vector parameter.
The third parameter defines the color and the fourth the width of the line.
This way the first to lines project the `X` and `Y` axis onto the screen and the third `DrawLine()` call paints the line from the origin of the graph to the poodle.

## `PoodleBehaviour.cs`
```csharp
using Godot;

public class PoodleBehaviour : Sprite
{
    private Label _label;

    public override void _Ready()
    {
        _label = GetNode<Label>("Label");
        _label.Text = $"( {Position.x} / {Position.y} )";
    }
}

```
Inside PoodleBehaviour.cs we only make sure that the label next to the poodle is filled with the `X` and `Y` coordinates of the Poodle Sprite.
We get the child-node `Label` with `GetNode<Label>("Label")` and assign it the `X` and `Y` coordinates of the Poodle by using C#'s [string interpolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated) feature.

After providing the respective nodes and attached scripts mentioned above, Godot should print you a nice Poodle infused vector visualisation.ðŸ¥³
