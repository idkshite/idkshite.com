Sometimes I need a bit more control over the output of commands. Maybe I want to analyze the error messages from a build process.
This is when `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` come in handy.
* `stdin` is the input of the command.
* `stdout` is the output of the command.
* `stderr` contains errors (and maybe warnings).

Technically the author of a command line tool can also return errors from `stdout` and normal output from `stderr` but conventionally the output is handled like above.

    Input and output of a command can be controlled with stdin, stdout and stderr.

In my example I would like to write the output of a next.js build process (`npm run build`) to a file.
I have multiple options to do so depending on what part of the output I'd like to focus on.

##  Log `stdout` to a file

```bash
  npm run build > temporaryDumpFile.txt
```
`>` (shorthand for `1>`) will redirect the `stdout` of the build command to the `temporaryDumpFile.txt` file
This way the console only contains errors and warnings and the temporaryDumpFile.txt has all the informational logs.

#### `temporaryDumpFile.txt`
```txt
> idkshite-blog@0.1.1 build
> next build

```

#### `terminal`
```bash

warn - The glob pattern ./content/posts/*.{mdx} in your Tailwind CSS configuration is invalid.
warn - Update it to ./content/posts/*.mdx to silence this warning.

<mark> In the following examples I will reframe from repeating the example output as it's always the same.</mark>


##  Log `stderr` to a file
```bash
  npm run build 2> temporaryErrorDumpFile.txt
```
Another option is to redirect the `stderr` to a file with `2>`. This way the console will only contain informational logs.

##  Log `stderr` and `stdout` to separate files
```bash
  npm run build > temporaryDumpFile.txt 2> temporaryErrorDumpFile.txt
```
With this command the console should stay empty, and you can analyze the errors and logs in separate files (here `temporaryErrorDumpFile.txt` and `temporaryDumpFile.txt`).

##  Log `stderr` and `stdout` to the same file
```bash
  npm run build > temporaryCombinedDumpFile.txt 2>&1
```
This way you'll combine the errors and logs in the same file, and receive the entire output from the console in one file.
The odd addition `2>&1` will tell the shell that you'd like to redirect `stderr` to the same target as `stdout`.
