Sometimes I'd like to propose some code changes to a colleague during a Pull Request Review.
Technically I could make this code change myself on the respective PR but that would be quite invasive If I don't have this colleagues confirmation to do so.
On the other hand explaining the change in the GitHub PR comments can be quite verbose.
Luckily GitHub offers a way to "suggest code changes".
The author can then decide whether they would like to directly commit, discuss the suggestion or ignore it.

## Creating a code suggestion
Follow these steps on any GitHub Pull request to propose code changes.

The PR author can now simply accept the suggestion.
