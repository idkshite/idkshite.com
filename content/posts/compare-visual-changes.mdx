Let's assume you've made some big changes to some global css styles in your web application.
You're unsure whether these changes broke any of your meticulously crafted pages.

You could set up automatic visual regression testing on your CI pipeline with tools from the ["Awesome Visual Regression Testing"](https://github.com/mojoaxel/awesome-regression-testing) list.
That would probably be the safest option. But it requires some setup and time to get used to the tools.

You don't have time for that right now? Then let me introduce you to...

## Manual Regression Testing
The idea is: **Take a screenshot** from a known working state of your webapp. For example your production environment. Then take this screenshot and **overlay it** on top of your potentially broken state of your webapp.
In this example I'm using the chrome plugins
* [screenshot-capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screenshot-capture/giabbpobpebjfegnpcclkocepcgockkc) - to get a **screenshot into my clipboard**
* [PerfectPixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - to **overlay the screenshot** on top of the development page

First I configured [screenshot-capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screenshot-capture/giabbpobpebjfegnpcclkocepcgockkc) to copy the screenshot into my clipboard and to use a different shortcut as the default one (`OPTION + S`) was already occupied by [PerfectPixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi).

### Prepare your browser
Then I prepare my browser to have both (local and production environment) open in equal sized browser windows.
It's important those pages have the **same viewport size** as comparing differently sized images will just make the process more complicated.
This also means the devtools need to be closed during the screenshot and comparison.
If the screenshot doesn't have the same size as the viewport of your browser window, you would need to manually position the screenshot later.

### Screenshot and compare
Next I take a screenshot of my production webapp running on `https://idkshite.com` (with `OPTION + SHIFT + S`).
This screenshot is now in my clipboard. I can switch to `http://localhost:3000/` and open [PerfectPixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) to click on the `paste from clipboard` link.
Now the screenshot of the reference page (production environment) should sit on top of the viewport of your localhost browser window.
Feel free to play around with the opacity slider to get an impression of how those changes differ.
Or turn your screenshot into a negative with `OPTION + i` to get a stronger contrast.

In the long run I would probably invest in some automated regression testing, but as a provisional arrangement it's way more reliable than just glancing over visual changes. üë®‚Äçüé®
