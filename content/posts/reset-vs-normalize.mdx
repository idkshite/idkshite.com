If you develop websites for multiple browsers you’ll quickly realize your un-styled HTML doesn't look the same in all browsers.
This makes it quite hard to keep up a consistent look and feel of a website among chrome, firefox, safari, brave, opera and browsers we better not call by their name.(Internet Expl...Psshhhhtt!)

## CSS standardization to the rescue
[normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/8.0.1/normalize.css) and [reset.css](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
try to solve this problem by providing a common ground for all browsers.

If we look at their respective websites their descriptions sound almost interchangeable:

### `normalize.css`
`normalize.css` claims to “make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards”
In `normalize.css` every single decision is documented and explained. It seems like every style change is there for a reason.

### `resize.css`
`reset.css` claims to “reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on”
Judging by the style definitions, `reset.css` takes a “roundhouse-kick” approach and simply strips all styles from common elements.

So if they are so similar. What’s the point of adding one over the other?

## When to choose which?

Choose `normalize.css` if:

- You want to think less about pesky browser inconsistencies
- You’re not planning to restyle every element from scratch

Choose `reset.css` if:

- you’d like to work from a blank canvas
- seek to restyle even the most elementary HTML elements
- you hate having to overwrite the default styles
