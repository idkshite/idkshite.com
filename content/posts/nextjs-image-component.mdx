I've been working with Next.js for a while now, but there is one component that for some reason I always forget how to use. The Image component.
I find myself constantly using props that have been deprecated and not truly understanding how to use it.
Now with Next.js 13 there is even a separate legacy image component, which gives us a hint that the image component has been a bit of a mess.
When researching how the component works exactly I realised i'm not the only one. There is a guy on YouTube who talks about the component for 1 hour minutes.
I'd say that's quite a lot for a component that is supposed to be easy to use.
