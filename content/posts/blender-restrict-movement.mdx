Today I learned a simple but powerful trick to keep your restrict movement in blender.
Imagine you want to move an object on a plane surface but blender keeps shoving your object "below the surface".

Ahhhrrgghh! Don't you hate that? ðŸ’©

You could move the object one by one on it's `X` and `Y` axis but that would be a bit tedious.
