Container queries allow you to write CSS that is responsive to the **size of the container** instead of the size of your screen.
They make it possible that components control their responsive styles on their own.

If you enjoy a short video introduction. Here is a (<2min) video explanation to container queries from the [State of CSS 2022](https://web.dev/state-of-css-2022/)

## How to use container queries?
For basic usage you define an element as your container.

```css
.almighty-sizer-box {
  container-type: inline-size;
}
```
After that you can define `@container` queries for your container, similar to the `@media` queries.
In this case I changed the font size of the box to be responsive to the size of the container and changed the padding and background color for better visual distinction.

```css
@container (max-width: 350px) {
  .almighty-sizer-box .inside {
    background-color: #3a475c;
    padding: 24px 16px;
  }
  .title {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
  .text {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
}
```

At the publishing date the of this post the browser support for container queries is still **"not really there"**.

If you want to use container queries right now, head over and grab the [Polyfill from GoogleChromeLabs](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/container-query-polyfill), which is compatible with all modern browsers.
Sadly at the publishing date of this post I couldn't get the polyfill to work with "named container queries". Hopefully that will change in the future.

## Example Usage
In this example I took the `.almighty-sizer-box` from above and squeezed it into a `200px` and a `400px` container.
Both boxes are using the same style definition. But through container queries they receive different styles. ðŸ¥³
*This example runs the GoogleChromeLabs polyfill, so you should see the container queries in action.*

If you're longing for a more complex example. Take a look at the [Container Queries Example by Una Kravets](https://web.dev/new-responsive/#container-query-cards).
*I forked the example from codepen to embed the polyfill*
