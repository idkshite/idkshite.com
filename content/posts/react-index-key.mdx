Today I learned that one shouldn't use the and `index` as the React `key` prop.
React asks developers to provide a unique `key` prop for lists in React for the sake of keeping track of the list items correct order.
Settings the `index` as your `key` stops React from complaining about the missing key prop but the problem persists because internally react already uses the index to infer the order (if key is missing).
