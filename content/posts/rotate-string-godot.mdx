Godot gives you the option to render strings with `DrawString(font, position, text)` inside the `_Draw` method of your Node.
But sadly there is no direct way to pass the rotation to this string.

# How to rotate your string
Luckily Godot offers a method that transform draw calls and rotate them.

```csharp
private void _DrawRotatedString(Vector2 position, float rotation, string text)
    {
        // sets this as the new reference for future Draw commands
        DrawSetTransform(position, rotation * (float)(Math.PI/ 180),Vector2.One);
        // Position of string is set to Vector2.Zero because DrawSetTransform already sets position
        DrawString(_dynamicFont, Vector2.Zero, text);
        // resets reference to global origin 0,0 without rotation
        DrawSetTransform(Vector2.Zero, 0,Vector2.One);

    }
```

Simply call `DrawSetTransform(position, rotation, scale)` before calling `DrawString()`.
Because I pass in the string rotation as degrees into my `_DrawRotatedString` function I first have to convert it into radians with: `rotation * (float)(Math.PI/ 180)`.
Most Godot functions handling rotation take radians instead of degrees.
I also pass in the final position of the string into the `DrawSetTransform` function because I observed unexpected behaviour when setting the position of `DrawSetTransform()` to `Vector2.zero` and the position of `DrawString()` to the target position.
The scale can stay at the default value, which is `Vector2.One`.

Then I happily draw my string with `DrawString(_dynamicFont, Vector2.Zero, text);`

Now it is of utmost importance to reset the `DrawSetTransform` back to `DrawSetTransform(Vector2.Zero, 0,Vector2.One);` which is the default setting.
Otherwise the transform of subsequent draw calls will be shifted and rotated.

For some context here is the entire class including the call of the `_DrawRotatedString` function and the import of the dynamic font.

```csharp

using Godot;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Data;

public class GraphBehaviour : Node2D
{
    DynamicFont _dynamicFont;
    public override void _Ready()
    {
        _dynamicFont = new DynamicFont();
        _dynamicFont.FontData = GD.Load<DynamicFontData>("res://InkbitThree.ttf");
        _dynamicFont.Size = 12;
    }


   public override void _Draw()
   {
        _DrawRotatedString(new Vector2(100,20), 90, "a 90 degree rotated label");
   }

   private void _DrawRotatedString(Vector2 position, float rotation, string text)
   {
        DrawSetTransform(position, rotation * (float)(Math.PI/ 180),Vector2.One);
        DrawString(_dynamicFont, Vector2.Zero, text);
        DrawSetTransform(Vector2.Zero, 0,Vector2.One);
   }

}

```
