The `.map()` method is a super valuable tool to transform arrays in JavaScript.
Sometimes I wish the same would exist for objects as well.
During a code review today I stumbled over this practical piece that applies `.map()` to an object.

## `.map()` over an object

In this example we're turning the `timestampSeconds` on the `clientEvent` into a timestamp with milliseconds by altering the key and value of this object property.

```ts
const clientEvent = Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(serverEvent).map(([key, value]) =>
      key === "timestampSeconds"
        ? ["timestampMillis", secondsToMilliseconds(value)]
        : [key, value]
    )
  );
```

The idea behind it is.
1. Turn an object into an array with `Object.entries()`. The object is now an array of arrays with key/value pairs (a [couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple)). It looks like this: `[[key,value],[key,value],[key,value],[key,value]]`
2. As your object is now an array, you can map over it and return the altered couples.
3. Once all couples have been altered you can reconstruct the object with `Object.fromEntries()`
