While building a [cross-posting](https://github.com/idkshite/idkshite.com/blob/main/src/pages/api/publish/%5BpostSlug%5D.ts) script on [idkshite.com](https://idkshite.com) I needed to replace jsx components in my `.mdx` files with Liquid tags that can be understood by dev.to’s editor.
The parser that i’m using to find all incompatible jsx components provides the start and end position of the component inside of the markdown string. So I couldn’t directly use `String.replace(stringToFind, replaceWithThis)`. To solve this problem, I came across this useful method to replace a string by a given position.

## Replace by position
The basic idea is creating 2 substrings before and after the content to be replaced. Then you construct a new string from the first `substring` + the new `content` + second `substring`.
Inside the result your text has been successfully replaced.

```ts
function replaceByPosition({
  text,
  position,
  replaceWith,
}: {
  text: string;
  position: {start: number, end: number};
  replaceWith: string
}) {
  return (
    text.substring(0, position.start) +
    replaceWith +
    text.substring(position.end + 1)
  );
}

```
