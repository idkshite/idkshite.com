I often forget the exact syntax to conditionally add a property to an object during initialisation.
In the end it is quite straight forward.
Let's imagine I only want to apply a `cover_video` to an imaginary `post` object if it actually exists.
That would look like this:

```js
const post = {
    title: "Wow what a nice post",
    text: "It's such a nice post. And so full of valuable information. I wonder if I can subscribe to this blog?",
    ...(cover_video ? {cover_video} : {})
}
```

JavaScript simply evaluates the part in between `(` and `)` as an expression and the result of the expression will be spread into the post object.
The expression only resolves to `{cover_video: cover_video}`(here shortened as `{cover_video}` because key and value are both `cover_video`) or to and empty object `{}`.
If you spread and empty object into another object it won't show up inside the target object. So it's perfect if you'd like to omit a property conditionally.
