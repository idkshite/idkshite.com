I've been working on a prototype for a timboxing app and wanted to use a library called [react-timer-hook](https://github.com/amrlabib/react-timer-hook).
The library was missing the feature to display time only in minutes instead of hours and minutes, so I [forked the repo](https://github.com/DATADEER/react-timer-hook) and added the feature.

I didn't want to create a new npm package because I don't expect that anyone else would benefit from this code change. Therefore I created a fork of the [react-timer-hook](https://github.com/amrlabib/react-timer-hook) code on github.
NPM allows you to **install** a package from a **github repo** with:
```bash
npm install <repo-url>
```
<em>In this case:</em>

```bash
npm install https://github.com/DATADEER/react-timer-hook
```

But I soon realised that this is not enough. As you can see in the `node_modules` folder of my app, the package is installed, but there is no sign of any code that i could import and use in my app.
Like most packages the package needs to be **built** before it can be used.

    the actual code of the library is missing because it requires a build step

There are at least 2 ways to solve this problem:

(1.) Build the package and **check** the dist folder **in**to the git repo ðŸ˜³ _This creates a lot of noise in your git commits and makes it harder to keep track of changes._

(2.) **Build** the package when **installing** it as a **dependency** ðŸ¤ 
_This is the solution I chose. I added a `prepare` script to the `package.json` of my forked repo._

```json
{
  "name": "react-timer-hook",
  "version": "3.0.5",
  [...]
  "scripts": {
    "build:demo": "rm -rf ./docs && webpack --config webpack.dev.js && webpack-dev-server --open --config webpack.dev.js",
    "build:prod": "rm -rf ./dist && webpack --config webpack.prod.js",
    "prepare": "npm run build:prod",
    "lint": "node_modules/.bin/eslint src"
  },
```
The `prepare` script is a built-in feature of npm, and it's executed when the package is installed as a dependency. It also runs if the package is installed from a git repo.
I chose to run the existing `build:prod` script. It runs the build command of the dependency and creates the `dist` folder.

    now the dist folder is created
</ImgWithText>

Now I can import the package and use it in my app as if it was a regular npm package.
