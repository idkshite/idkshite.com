Godot offers a rich set of Animation Tooling. It helps you to move things, size them and alter pretty much any node property you can think of.
But those animations don't run in a vacuum. After they run you may want to run other code.

But how do you know when the **animation has finished?**

## Awaiting signals
Using C# I can await signals with the `await ToSignal(...);` method. `ToSignal()` listens to the signals from the **Node** passed in as the **first argument**. In this case I'd like to listen to the `_animationPlayer`. The **second argument** determines the **signal** to listen to.
In this case I'd like to wait until the triggered animation has finished. We can do that by listening to the `animation_finished` signal on the `_animationPlayer`.

As `ToSignal()` runs asynchronously, we need to wrap our code in a function that uses the `async` keyword. Otherwise, we can't use `await`.
After awaiting the function we can make our main character disappear or run any other code. The world is your oyster. ðŸ¦ª

```csharp
 private async void Kill()
{
    _animationPlayer.Play("Die");
    await ToSignal(_animationPlayer, "animation_finished");
    _character.Visible = false

}
```

There are also other ways to execute code after a signal has been triggered. For example through adding a [Call Method Track](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/animation/animation_track_types.html#call-method-tracks) in your `AnimationPlayer`. On this track you can call methods from your nodes and other scripts.

But I would argue that `ToSignal()` creates more readable code as the logical flow is traceable line by line, without having to jump to the `AnimationPlayer` in Godot.
