Recently I needed to create a lot of test documents one after another and inspect them after creation.
There this mongoDB query turned out to be quite useful.
Every time you execute it, it shows you the latest document inside your collection (here `purchases`);

```mongodb
db.getCollection('purchases').find().sort({createdAt:-1}).limit(1)
```

1. `find()` yields all documents from the collection.
2. `sort({createdAt:-1})` sorts the results in descending order (largest to smallest) based on their creation date.
3. `limit(1)` only shows one results from all results
