Today I learned that you can dynamically import components in your Next.js project.
According to the <Link url="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import">Next.js docs</Link>
your simply import your react component with:

```js
import Dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const YourDynamicComponent = Dynamic(() => import('../components/hello'))

{/* Use it like any other component*/}
<YourDynamicComponent/>
```

In this example it is expected that the imported component is default exported.

```js

export default function YourDynamicComponent() {

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>So dynamic and fresh</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## ðŸ¤© Interactive Example
Give a try. This example if fully interactive.Just run the Replit.

We're loading a component that displays the current Date and formats it with the
luxon library. Both are loaded dynamically.
