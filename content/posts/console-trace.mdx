Recently one of my colleagues showed me a nifty trick how you can find out from where your code was called.
The problem was that I had a function that was called from multiple places inside the application,
but I needed to find out which specific part/function inside the app called it.
Just `console.log`ing something inside the function didn't do the trick because I couldn't who triggered the function which caused the log.

## `console.log(new Error())`
The answer lies in calling `console.log("whatever you want to log", new Error())` inside of the function you want to inspect.
`new Error()` will give you a stacktrace inside your console next to the desired log message.

In my contrived example below I want to find out who called `getUsername()`.
It is called inside `showDashboard()` and `showProfile()`.
If you open your console and click on the `console.log` button below you will see a stacktrace that shows you, it was called in
`showDashboard()`.

## `console.trace()`
If you have lots of logs in your console it may be a bit confusing to see logs containing the word `Error` without being an actual error.
This is where `console.trace()` comes to the rescue.
It works pretty much like the previous example, except you don't need to provide `new Error()`.
This creates slightly more tidy and descriptive code during debugging.

You can try it out below by opening your console and clicking the `console.trace` button.
Make sure your dev-tools console is open, otherwise you may not see the full stacktrace.

So why not used it everytime? Sadly `console.trace` is not supported in all environments.
For example. If you open the built-in console of the codesandbox below, you won't see any stacktrace from `console.trace`.

Of course, I can also use a debugger to get the stacktrace from a breakpoint inside of a function.
But there are scenarios where using a debugger is either impossible or impractical.
Then it's good to know an alternative. ðŸ¥³
