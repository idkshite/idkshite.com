By-default the bullet points of an HTML lists `<li>` tag are vertically aligned to the top.
Even if the text inside-of the `<li>` spans over multiple lines the bullet stays top aligned.
When I was faced with this problem I was tempted to try changing the `list-style-position` css property of the `<ul>`.
But contrary to it's name, `list-style-position` only changes whether the bullet point of your list is inside
the `<ul>` html block or outside.

## ðŸ”« Vertically center your customer bullet list item

The approach I took requires you to put the text inside the `<li>`'s into `<span>`'s.

```html
<ul class="real-bullets">
  <li><span>it's raining cats and dogs</span></li>
  <li><span>break a leg</span></li>
  <li><span>Give someone the benefit of the doubt</span></li>
</ul>
```

next you need to vertically align your `span` inside the `li` with

```css
li > span {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

ðŸ¤” *I'm not sure why `display: inline-block;` is necessary and `display: inline;` isn't enough. But that may be the topic for another day.*

## So `vertical-algin` is useful after all?
Before `flexbox` existed I often tried to vertical center boxes in layouts with `vertical-align: middle` and was wondering why it worked so rarely.
Thanks to the <Link url="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align">mdn docs</Link> I now know that `vertical-align` only works in two use-cases.

* To vertically align an inline element's box inside its containing inline box.
* To vertically align content in a table cell.

So unless you build your layout with `inline` elements or `table`s you're out of luck if you're tyring to use `vertical-align: middle` for your page layout, like I did.
