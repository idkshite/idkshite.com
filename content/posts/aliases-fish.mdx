Sometimes I see myself typing the same command + parameters combination over and over
as if they should be the default behaviour for the command.

For me `ls -a` is such a candidate. The `-a` flag includes files and directories starting with `"."` into the list command.
Most of the time when I use the terminal I also interact with code. Therefor I want to see all code related files (including files like `.gitignore`).

## üê° Define an alias with fish
With fish it's a breeze to define an alias.
I opened `~/.config/fish/config.fish` (create one if it doesn't exist yet).

Then I added the line `alias ls="ls -a"` to replace `ls` with `ls -a`.

No worries, you can still pass any additional argument to your `ls` alias.
