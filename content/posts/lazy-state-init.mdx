Imagine you have an expensive operation that prefills the initial value of your useState in React.
With the default way the function providing your initial value would be executed on each rerender.

## Default way of setting state
```ts
const [audioURL, setAudioURL] = useState(expensiveOperation());
```

In this example we're "calculating" the source url for and audio sample in `expensiveOperation()` and setting it as the default value of `audioURL`.
If this was a truly "expensive operation" it would slow down your application on every rerender.

## Setting state as a function

In order to prevent all these reruns of `expensiveOperation()` we can initialize `useState` with a function instead.
```ts
const [audioURL, setAudioURL] = useState(() => expensiveOperation());
```

<mark>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execute this Replit, keep the browser console open and write something into the input to see how the `expensiveOperation()` gets called only once ü•≥.</mark>
<Replit url="https://replit.com/@idkshite/react-state-lazy-initialization-fixed"/>

Now the `expensiveOperation()` is only run once on the initial render. Your application will not be slowed down by subsequent initializations ü•≥.
