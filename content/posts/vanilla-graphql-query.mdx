If I have the choice between requesting data via a **REST API** or a **GraphQL API** I perceive the REST API as the simpler option.
The one that causes fewer headaches. But I'm pretty sure that's mainly because I have the impression that requesting data from a GraphQL API requires a library.
And to be honest, I haven't looked at the source code of [ApolloClient](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/client) or any other GraphQL client.
In this post I have challenged myself to prove that I don't necessarily need a library to make a GraphQL request.

## No magic involved ðŸ§™

For this example I'm fetching data from the free [countries API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/countries/home?variant=current).

I started by importing `axios` as my HTTP request library of choice. You can also use `fetch` or `https`. Whatever suits your needs, will do.

Next we provide the url for the `POST` request, which is simply the graphql endpoint of the API.
In this case `https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql`.
Other than that the `POST` request expects up to 3 properties passed as a `JSON` object.
* `query`: Our GraphQL query as a string with all the desired variables and fields
* `variables`: [Optional] In case you have variables in your query, you need to provide their value here as a `JSON` object
* `operationName`: [Optional] Even though it's optional, it helps to identify your operations if they fail on the server

```typescript
import axios from "axios";

async function getCountryData(code: "DE"|"NL"|"US"|"BR"|"BF"){
 const response = await axios.post("https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql", {
  operationName: "CoolCountryOperation",
  query: `query CoolCountryOperation($code: ID!) {
  country(code: $code) {
    code
    name
    native
    capital
    emoji
    currency
    languages {
      code
      name
    }
  }
}`,
variables: {code: code}
});
return response?.data;
}

getCountryData("BF").then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```

And as you can see in the Replit below, that's it!

Just by providing these basic properties, the `POST` requests returns your queried data without an additional library.ðŸ¥³
