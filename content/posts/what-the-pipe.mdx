What does it mean if a variable in a Mathematics formula is surrounded by two vertical lines?

According to [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=%7Ca%7C) *"`|z|` is the absolute value of z."*

I guess whether I take `|z|` or `|a|` doesn't really matter, so I'll continue with `|a|` as it seems more common.

In laymen terms this the statement from WolframAlpha means we're taking the actual value from `a` while disregarding the algebraic sign (`+` or `-`).


So if `a = -2.5` then `|a|` represents the value `2.5`

If `a = 3.14` then `|a|` equals the value `3.14`


You can see the two `|` `|` surrounding the variable name as some kind of programming function that returns the distance from `0` to `a`.
In-fact it exists in languages like `C#` as the `{Math.Abs(value)}` function.
But even if this function wouldn't exist in your programming language of choice you could implement it as `sqrt(a^2)` (sqrt is the square-root).
Making `a` squared gets rid of the algebraic sign (2*2 and -2*-2 are both 4). And the square root reverses the effect of the quadration without gaining back the algebraic sign.


In mathematical terms `|a|` you may come across this notation described ast the `absolute value` or `modulus` of the real number `a`.

In case you're looking for a more exhaustive definition, I can recommend this [3 part video by Eddie Woo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzpnElPDJcA).
